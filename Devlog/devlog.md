Development logs, uptdates, lore, curiosities and more about the human aspect of developing this game.

## Day 4
### Starting the devlog

I decided to start documenting the development through here too. The individual updates to the game's features are already well documented on the commit history, so this will serve as a registry of the other aspects of development.

This includes ideas I had, tests I made, weird happenings and other (hopefully) interesting things.

* After playing around with the designer interface for a while, I decided to make a few corrections to it. When adjusting the weapon arm, the sword angle remains constant now (it feels more intuitive). The head is now always parallel to the torso too.
